# Turrican II
 Turrican II port Atari 8-bit

Our attempt to commercially port Turrican II from C64 to Atari 8-bit, circa 1992.
The effort failed primarily due to 8-bit platforms demise.

The game was compiled with omc65 crossassembler on Atari ST (Mega STe to be exact - we had two of those machines).

It would be nice to get it compiling under a modern assembler and a bit cleaned up. It would still be a very nice engine for freely scrolling platformer with huge levels.
